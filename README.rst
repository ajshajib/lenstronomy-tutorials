Requirements
------------
The notebooks require lenstronomy release version 1.10.4.
Instructions for installing lenstronomy and its dependencies can be found in the Installation_
section of the lenstronomy documentation.

.. _Installation: https://lenstronomy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/installation.html

If you are using the GitHub branch of ``lenstronomy``, you may be a bit ahead of the notebooks.


Need help or provide feedback?

Get in touch with the lenstronomy developers (lenstronomy-dev@googlegroups.com) if you encounter problems.


Attribution
-----------
A first set of notebooks were written by Simon Birrer `sibirrer <https://github.com/sibirrer/>`_ as the
`lenstronomy_extensions <https://github.com/sibirrer/lenstronomy_extensions>`_ package.
Please follow the lenstronomy citation guidelines in using these notebooks.
